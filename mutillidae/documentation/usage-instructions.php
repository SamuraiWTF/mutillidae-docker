			Mutillidae implements vulnerabilities from the 
			<a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Project" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10</a> 
			2013, 2010 and 2007 in PHP.
			Additionally vulnerabilities from the SANS Top 25 Programming Errors and select information 
			disclosure vulnerabilities have been added on various pages.

			<span class="report-header">Left Menu Bar</span>
			<br/><br/>
			The menu on the left is organized by category then vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities
			will be in more than one category as there is overlap between categories. Each
			page in Mutillidae will expose multiple vulnerabilities. Some pages have half a dozen
			and/or multiple critical vulnerabilities on the same page. The page will appear in the menu
			under each vulnerability.
			<br/><br/>
			A <a title="Listing of vulnerabilities" href="./index.php?page=./documentation/vulnerabilities.php">listing of vulnerabilities</a> 
			is available in menu under documentation or by clicking 
			<a title="Listing of vulnerabilities" href="./index.php?page=./documentation/vulnerabilities.php">here</a>.

			<span class="report-header">Videos</span>
			<br/><br/>
			The videos on the Webpwnized YouTube Channel are likely to be a some assistance. Videos 
			cover installation, using tools like Burp-Suite and exploits for various
			vulnerabilities.

			<span class="report-header">Page Hints</span>
			<br/><br/>
			Besides the menus, this will be the most important feature for newcomers. To enable hints,
			toggle the "Show Hints" button (top menu bar). A hints section will appear IF the page contains
			vulnerabilities. The Hints are "smart" showing only those hints that will help on the particular
			page. 
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<span class="report-header">Security Modes</span>
			<br/><br/>
			Mutillidae currently has three modes: completely insecure, client-side security and secure. 
			In insecure and client-side mode, the pages are vulnerable to at least the topic they 
			fall under in the menu. Note that client-side security mode is just as vulnerable as 
			insecure mode, but JavaScript validation or HTML controls make exploits somewhat more
			difficult.
			<br/><br/>
			In secure mode, 
			Mutillidae attempts to protect the pages with server side scripts. Also, hints are disabled.
			<br/><br/>
			The mode can be changed using the "Toggle Security" button on the top menu bar. 
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<span class="report-header">"Help Me" Button</span>
			<br/><br/>
			The "Help Me" button provides a basic
			description of the vulnerabilities on the page for which the user should try exploits.
			Use this button to get a quick list of issues. Use the Hints to see more details.
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<span class="report-header">Bubble Hints</span>
			<br/><br/>
			If the 
			"Bubble Hints" are enabled (top menu bar), some of the vulnerable locations will have bubble
			hints pop up when the user hovers the mouse over the vulnerable field or area. 
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<span class="report-header">Just give me the exploit</span>
			<br/><br/>
			Hints will typically provide some exploits. 
			Known exploits that are used in testing Mutillidae are located in 
			/documentation/mutillidae-test-scripts.txt. There is some documentation for each exploit
			which explains usage and location.
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<span class="report-header">Be Careful</span>
			<br/><br/>
			Mutillidae is a "live" system. The vulnerabilities are real rather than emulated. This eliminates
			the frustration of having to "know what the author wants". Because of this, there are likely 
			undocumented vulnerabilities. Also, this project endangers any machine on which it runs. Best practice 
			is to run Mutillidae in a virtual machine isolated from the network which is only booted
			when using Mutillidae. Every effort has been made to make Mutillidae ables run entirely off-line.
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<span class="report-header">Whitepaper</span>
			<br/><br/>
			A project whitepaper is available to explain the features of Mutillidae and suggested use-cases.
