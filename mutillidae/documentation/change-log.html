	<div>Change Log for OWASP Mutillidae II 2.6.57:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Created independent configuration file for database credentials
			to make it easier to add Mutillidae into Samurai WTF 4.
			The congiuration file is includes/database-config.php.
			The class that handles the database connection is still
			MySQLHandler.php. The config file contains the following by
			default:
			<br/>
			define('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
			define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
			define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
			define('DB_NAME', 'mutillidae');
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed the default database name to mutillidae to make it more
			obvious which database belongs to which application on systems
			with lots of target applications
		</li>
		<li>Added another video on command injection</li>

			It's getting harder and harder to write code as awful as I would like.

			Added a new hint to the XML enternal entity injection hints. Credit: Robin @digininja Wood

		<li>
			BUG FIX: When setting up the database the youTubeVideos table is created with this column
			identificationToken varchar(16). The first entry you then try to put into it has a token of 
			"YouTubeVideoIdentifier" which is longer than 16 characters so doesn't fit.
			This caused an error on the setup script if mysql is running in strict mode.

	<div>Change Log for OWASP Mutillidae II 2.6.23:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Installed new hint handling system that displays the hints into a new tab rather than
			having the hint shown inline on the target web page. This frees up a lot of 
			space on the target page and makes it possible to move back and forth
			between the hint and the page.
		</li>
		<li>Hints now show by default but are contained in a hidden div element</li>
		<li>Created new page hints-page-wrapper.php</li>
		<li>Renamed hints-wrapper.inc to hints-menu-wrapper.inc</li>
		<li>Renamed hints.js.inc to hints-menu.js.inc</li>
		<li>Added new column level_1_help_include_file_description to table level_1_help_include_files</li>
		<li>
			BUG FIX: The YouTubeVideoHandlerClass was missing a reference to the remote file handler class.
			This error went unnoticed because the index.php already included a reference that the 
			You Tube handler happended to be able to use.
		</li>
		<li>BUG FIX: Minor documentation errors in SQLQueryHandler.php</li>
		<li>BUG FIX: Minor formatting improvements on teh Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Hint page</li>

	<div>Change Log for OWASP Mutillidae II 2.6.18:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			BUG FIX: Patched index.php page. Some paths to project
			dependencies and included pages
			were relative paths rather than absolute paths
			that start from root. This left the paths vulnerable to 
			path-relative stylesheet import (PRSSI) vulnerabilities.
			This vulnerability was not intentional and could lead to 
			page defacement when trying to implement some intentional 
			vulnerabilities. Referece: http://blog.portswigger.net/2015/02/prssi.html
		</li>
		<li>
			Patched add-to-your-blog.php for path-relative 
			stylesheet import (PRSSI) vulnerabilities
		</li>
		<li>
			Added new method getUserAccountByID() to SQLQueryHandler class
		</li>
		<li>
			Updated index.php page to use object oriented query to fetch user
			account information
		</li>
		<li>Added a little more documentation comments to index.php</li>
		<li>Moved favicon.ico into images directory</li>
		<li>Fixed overly complex code for the click-jacking demonstration
		in index.php and framing.php</li>
		<li>Fixed IF statement in index.php that was overly complex</li>
		<li>
			Removed hard-coded document-type meta tag from header element 
			of each page. The content-type needs to be set with an HTTP
			header.
		</li>
		<li>Added the content-type via HTTP header within index.php</li>
		<li>
			Added a new vulnerability: Path Relative Stylesheet Injection.
			The page in Mutillidae that implements is styling.php. It is
			acessible from several menus including XSS.
			This is described by Gareth Heyes at 
			http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2014/03/21/rpo/
			and again on the Portswigger blog at http://blog.portswigger.net/.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added Path Relative Stylesheet Injection to the bubble hints, the
			"Help" button and the built-in hints. Extensive help is available in 
			the built-in hints. The user has to click the "Toggle Hints" to activate the
			hints system.
		</li>
		<li>
			Created a video tutorial for Path Relative Stylesheet Injection and
			uploaded to YouTube. The video can be accessed by opening the hints
			for Path Relative Stylesheet Injection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added to several menus such as XSS, HTMLi and others

	<div>Change Log for OWASP Mutillidae II 2.6.3:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added new RESTful web service ws-user-account.php.
			Service accepts GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods

			be fetched. If no username is passed, a list of
			usernames will be returned.
		</li>
		<li>
			Refactoring some of the web service code to make it 
			easier to read. Getting ready for ISSA Conference
			presentation.
		</li>
		<li>

	<div>Change Log for OWASP Mutillidae II 2.6.0:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A new section has been added to most hints on most pages. The "video"
			section contains either a link to the video or a frame with the video
			embedded. Mutillidae will detect if Curl is installed and if the Internet
			is reachable. If those preconditions fail, the link will be displayed.
			If Mutillidae is mistaken about connectivity and the link is displayed
			rather than the frame, the user can still click the link to open 
			the video in a new tab.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add hint reminder to Home page growl notification 
			to let users know hints are available
		</li>
		<li>Fixed bug in code examples on XML XXE hint</li>

			This attack takes advantage that the injection causes an error from

			The browser executes the JavaScript when viewing the error.

		<li>The setup datebase page now clears HTML 5 Local and Session Storage</li>
		<li>Fixed alignment issues with icons on the captured-data page.</li>
		<li>
			Partially protected capture-data.php page so that the page can capture

		</li>
		<li>Added timestamp to records captured in the captured-data.txt text file</li>

			HTML 5 storage page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Coverted log-visit.php from using the hitlog table to using the 
			LogHandler class. This will help consolodate code into a single
			point of failure for the logging process. All the code has been removed
			from log-visit.php except a call to the LogHandler.
		</li> 
		<li>Adjusted top horizontal menu padding to move buttons closer together</li>
		<li>
			Added two new buttons to the top horizontal menu to allow user to get
			to the view log page and the view captured data page easier.
		</li>
		<li>
			Removed the gethostbyaddr() function from the LogHandler to prevent the 
			long timeouts associated with the function when the DNS server is not
			available. If PHP changes so that the function has a timeout setting
			it will be brought back.
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed delete icon from jpeg to a transparent PNG so the icon can be put inline
			to the table headers to save space.
		</li>
		<li>Added delete log button to the show log page.</li>
		<li>Rearranged the buttons on the show logs page, added new icons, and cleaned up the code</li>

	<div>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.1.15:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Upgraded the "JavaScript Validation" for the dns-lookup.php page. The 
			JavaScript validation is only activated in security level 1. The new
			validation checks for cross-site scripting characters in addition to
			OS command injection characters.
			
			The validations are trivial to defeat by disabling JS in the browser 
			or using an interception proxy to bypass the validation.
		</li>
		<li>
			In security level 1, on page add-to-your-blog.php the CSRF token
			is now generated. The token is predictable although perhaps not
			obvious. The intention is for students to use Burp-Suite 
			sequencer to discover the pattern and inject the next token in
			the sequence (or to subtract each token from the last token).
		</li>
		<li>
			The CSRF token generator for the add-to-your-blog.php page is 
			now using the OWASP Randomizer to generate random tokens
			in security level 5. The previous generator used mt_random()
			which was not really random.
			
			These new tokens have an entropy of around 132 bits.

		</li>
		<li>
			Added lots of HTML5 attacks to the easter egg file Mutillidae-Test-Scripts.txt
		</li>
		<li>
			Added new page capture.php which captures any information sent to the page
			in GET or POST parameters and saves them to a database table. Can be used
			to capture cookies, session storage, local storage, or other data. The page is 
			designed to reflect the capture cookie page used in the SANS 542 Web Application
			Pen Testing course currently taught by Kevin Johnson of SecureIdeas.
			
			This page is designed to capture any parameters sent and store them in a file 
			and a database table. It loops through the POST and GET parameters and records 
			them to a file named captured-data.txt. On Windows system, the file should be 
			found at C:/xampp/htdocs/mutillidae/captured-data.txt. The page also tries to 
			store the captured data in a database table named captured_data. There is 
			another page named captured-data.php that attempts to list the contents of 
			this table.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added new page captured-data.php which displays data captured by page
			capture.php. In true Mutillidae fashion, this page is as vulnerable as
			all the others. Try hacking the hacker by sending SQL injections and XSS
			to the capture.php.

			injectable to cause XSS. The menu item is located under OWASP Top 10 --&gt;
			A2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) --&gt; Via HTTP Headers --&gt; Those BACK Buttons.
			Any page will do. I just picked one at random.
		</li>

			Corrected some errors in the HTML5 storage hints. You have to enable HINTS level 1
			to see the hints. The HINTS button is on the menu at the top of the screen.

		<li>Fixed a minor formatting bug in html5-storage.php</li>
		<li>Adjusted the graphics on the home page</li>
		<li>
			Added a new page pen-test-tool-lookup.php. This page is vulnerable to JSON injection.
			A large tutorial was added as well showing how to perform JavaScript XSS injection
			into the JSON data so that the XSS executes.
			To see the tutorial, click the HINTS button. As an exercise, the user is encouraged
			to perform a JSON string injection and an HTML injection after learning how to
			perform the XSS injection. The JSON has been carefully designed to make it relatively
			easier to get the JSON injection to work. JSON injection can be somewhat tricky 
			if a user has not tried it before and/or does not use JSON in web applications.
			The HINTS button is on the menu at the top of the screen.
			The page is also vulnerable to SQL injection, HTML injection, 
			and JSON string injection in addition to XSS.
		</li>
		<li>
			The next step will be to add defenses to pen-test-tool-lookup.php. There will
			be a level 1 defense and a level 5 defense. The level 1 will just be
			JavaScript validation. Level 5 defense will be more robust and
			hopefully difficult to defeat. This will be release 2.1.11 or later.

	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new page for HTML5 storage. The page is meant to show how to both use 
			and attack HTML5 storage. The page supports Local and Session storage types.
			The user can attack the storage in two contexts. They can act as if they want 
			to read to contents of their own browsers session storage to see if the 
			developer put authorization tokens or other items into the storage.
			They can also try to use XSS to steal the session storage. In this use-case
			the user would be acting as if they wanted to read someone elses storage.
			A large number of hints has been added to the page. The page name is 
			"html5-storage.php" and can be accessed from the Cross Site Scripting menu
			and information leakage menu. In security level zero, the page has no defenses.
			In level 1, the page will use trivial JavaScript validation. In security level 5,
			the page will refuse to put the secrets in client side storage.

	<div>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.1.3:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Fix a bug. If the user was on the home page, without having clicked any
			link to this point (such as when using a bookmark), then the user clicked the 
			"change security level", the page would redirect to page not found.
		</li>
		<li>Increased the slide time for the ddsmoothmenu to make it slow down a little bit</li>
		<li>Added a NEW vulnerability. Many sites have crazy pages that show server settings, expose
			admin functionality, allow configuration, or other features a user should not be able to 
			see. The problem is not the pages themselves so much as the fact that developers think
			no one will guess the name and browse to them. Shoulder surfing, guessing, brute-forcing, etc
			can be used to find these pages. Mutillidae now has such a page. It is in the 
			"Server Misconfiguration" category. See secret-administrative-pages.php for hints.
		</li>
		<li>Augmented the installation instructions</li>
		<li>Added link to ihackcharities to front page</li>

	<div>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.1.2:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new security level. Now there is security level 1. The only difference
			in this release between level 0 and level 1 is that level 1 has JS validation.
			The JS validation has been in place for a while to allow but was activated in
			level 0. Since level 0 is supposed to be very easy, the decision was made
			to create level 1 and move JS validation to level 1. The JS validation is
			trivial to bypass. Simply disable JS or use a proxy such as Tamper Data,
			Paros, Burp, WebScarab, or others.
		</li>
		<li>Page homenotes.php has been merged with home.php.</li>
		<li>Page home.html has been renamed home.php</li>
		<li>Added protection for SQL injection to add to your blog.php output of the 
			current users blog entries. Prior to this patch, you could SQL inject 
			in security level 5 by putting your injection in the current users
			login name because the query uses the current users login name as the input
			to the query.
		</li>
		<li>Improved the DNS lookup page to add JS validation in security level 1 mode.</li>
		<li>Changed padding for BACK button to use styles rather than HTML BR tags.</li>
		<li>Changed the password generator password length to 15 to set a better
			example.</li>
		<li>Some refactoring on user-info.php and login.php to clean up code</li>

	<div>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.1.0:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Fixed error on page add to your blog. Input user was not escaped or encoded in secure mode.
		</li>
		<li>
			Major change. The MYSQL connection has been changed from procedure mysql_ functions to using
			object oriented instances from the class mysqli. mysqli became available in PHP 5.3.0
			and is brand new to Mutillidae. There is a high chance of error. Please let me
			know if there are bugs found. This new class gives us many new abilities
			including the ability to call stored procedures without using concatenation. This 
			change affects the entire project and changes the capabilities of the project
			which is why the minor version was updated.
			
			All of the database code has been ripped out and replaced from the ground up. Next will
			be to add stored procedures and views to the database. When SQL injection is done on
			meta data, there will be many more targets. Users will be able to steal the source code
			from views and procs during pen tests along with dumping tables.
		</li>
		<li>Added row number to output on add to your blog</li>
		<li>Added logging for successful and failed login attempts.</li>
		<li>Fixed bug in closing bold tag tokenizer on add to your blog</li>
		<li>
			Updated page arbitrary-file-inclusion.php. 
			Now you can practice making arbitrary system files load. The fun never ends.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added SQL injection defenses to closedb.inc. This may not make much sense unless
		you know that closedb.inc logs to the hitlog table. Part of what it logs is user agent
		and referer which are controls by the user.
		</li>
		<li>Create new page log-visit.php which logs each request to the server. This page
		could be used to poison the log with XSS or SQL inject the database.
		</li>
		<li>Fix bug on dns-lookup.php that allowed the log to be injected even in secure mode.</li>
		<li>Add new page vulnerabilities.php that document the vulnearbilities on each page to help
		users know what to try</li>
		<li>Renamed home.htm to home.html for compliance with convention</li>
		<li>Reconfigured index.php to open database as late as possible</li>
		<li>Refactored opendb.inc to use standard error handling like rest of site. Page
		size is much smaller as a result</li>
		<li>Added a new XSS vulnerability to page user-info.php. This can be exploited by inputing scripts
		into the username field.</li>
		<li>Added row count output to the show-log.php page</li>
		<li>Fixed back button so it doesnt span entire width of the page</li>
		<li>Added error output to page register.php. In insecure mode, the user can get a lot
		of information about the insert. In secure mode, we keep that to ourselves.</li>

	<div>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.8:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added more comments to the code to explain how defenses work</li>
		<li>
		Added support for the &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; tag to the blog. In secure mode Mutillidae will allow this tag
		but still safely encode output and stop XSS.</li>
		<li>
		Added JavaScript filtering to prevent single quotes from being entered in blog entries. This give practice 
		bypassing JavaScript "security" and helps the user understand JavaScript cannot provide security.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added lots of JS filtering to login.php. Nearly all characters are filtered. Users are encouraged
			to understand that JavaScript and filtering are useless for security.
		</li> 
		<li>Added autofocus to login.php and add-to-blog.php</li>
		<li>
			Added more "allowed dangerous HTML tags" to the blog. Until now only the bold HTML tag was supported. Also
			the output was not HTML5 compliant. For example, if the user entered a bold tag, then a bold tag was output
			however the bold tag is depreciated. Styles must be used. So Mutillidae allows the user to input
			a bold tag but will correctly encode this as a sytle upon output. The italic tag is now supported
			as a dangerous input which is safely output without fear of Cross Site Scripting. These defenses
			only operate in secure mode of course. In insecure mode, the site allows any input and simply outputs
			whatever is input without any encoding.
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed menu for OWASP A1 - Injection to differentiate between SQL, HTML, and Command Injection. This should make
			it more clear which pages exhibit vulnerabilities with the specific injecton sub-types. Also added new link for 
			Blind SQL Injection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed menu for OWASP A2 - Cross Site Scripting to differentiate between XSS coming in via user supplied fields 
			(GET/POST) and values within HTTP Request Headers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added tutorials feature.
		</li>
		<li>Added SQL Injection Totorial</li>
		<li>Added Cross Site Scripting tutorial</li>
		<li>Added Command Injection tutorial</li>		
		<li>
			Added new feature. Hints can now be at different levels. Each time the user clicks Hints, the level increases by 1 until rolling over.
		</li>
		<li>Removed the installation instructions from the home page. A new page for instructions is created and linked from the menu.
		<li>
			Augmented the installation instructions to include running from Samurai, creating a custom ISO, installing 
			to XAMPP, and running in virutal machines.
		</li>
		<li>Reformatted install instructions and main home page to be compliant with HTML 5</li>

	<div>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.7:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new page rene-magritte.php to explore click-jacking.
			
			In secure mode, Mutillidae will send the X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY
			header. In modern browsers, this will cause the browser to throw an
			error rather than allow the page rene-magritte.php to be framed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added a resources link to the main menu. Links are to information
			or tools that can help with testing Mutillidae.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added new class LogHandler to take over logging. Previously
			logging statements has to be copied to each spot that logging
			was needed. With the new class, logging requires only one
			line of code and the logger automatically logs based on the 
			current security level. If in insecure mode, no attempt
			to stop XSS or SQLi is made.
			
			With the new class, many less lines of code are needed and many
			more places log. With more places logging, there is a much better
			chance of finding a log exploit and taking advantage (insecure mode).
			
			Logging added to pages: add-to-your-blog, dns-lookup, text-file-viewer,
			source-viewer.php, register.php, redirectandlog.php, and user-info.php

			now require users to be able to enter a bold tag
			in their blog.

			In secure mode, Mutillidae allows this functionality while still 
			protecting the users from mallicous injection input.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new secret page has been added. There are lots of test scripts
			that the developers used to hack Mutillidae inside. It will be very hard

	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new security vulnerability and counteracting secure code.
			Cookies are unprotected in insecure mode, but in secure mode, the
			cookies will have the HTTPOnly attribute applied to them.
			
			In reality this vulnerability was always in Mutillidae since ignoring
			the issue opens the vulnerability (the ability for scripts to access the
			cookie values). The change is acknowleging this issue and adding the 
			defense. 
			
			Once we get an SSL certificate installed, the next logical step will be to 
			add the "Secure" attribute to cookies in secure mode, but to not
			add this attribute in insecure mode. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Added the X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY click-jacking defense in secure mode.
			In insecure mode, the site does nothing and ignores the issue entirely.
			This defense only works in newer browsers and javascript framebusters are
			needed to help older browsers.
		</li>
		<li>Added insecure comments vulnerability and defense. Some developers use 
			HTML or JavaScript comments instead of using the frameworks comments 
			(ASP.NET, Java, PHP, Etc.)
		</li>
		<li>Rearranged instructions on home page to emphasize the PHP.ini 
			configuration changes that are needed to get rid of errors.
		</li>
