			Click Jacking may occcur when an attacker is able to frame the target web page.
			This can allow the attacker to overlay an invisible block of HTML such as an
			invisible form. When the user clicks on what they think is the legitimate web
			page, they are interacting with the overlay instead. If the overlay happens to
			be a form (for example), the user is filling out and submitting the fake form.

			Check to see if the site send the X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP header with a value of
			DENY or SAMEORIGIN. If the X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP header is not present in each 
			response, check if JavaScript "frame-busting" code is present.

			Mutillidae overlays the page with a div which follows the mouse around.
			When the user clicks anywhere, they inevitably click the div which then executes
			the JavaScript in the onclick event.
