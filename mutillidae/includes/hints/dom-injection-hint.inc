			<br/><br/>
			DOM Injection may occcur when the web page uses DOM manipulation to update
			the HTML of the page in response to user input. This is typically done
			using JavaScript.
			<br/><br/>
			<span class="report-header">Discovery Methodology</span>
			<br/><br/>
			Locate pages which use DOM manipulation to update the page without 
			returning to the server. This can often be detected when a client proxy
			such as Burp does NOT intercept a request when a page updates.

			<span class="report-header">Exploitation</span>
			<br/><br/>
			Inject the field or event from which the page will be updated and inject HTML or
			JavaScript into the field or event.

			<span class="report-header">Example</span>
			<br/><br/>
			Use Firebug or similar to examine the message that appears when a new
			item is added to storage. The message appears in a label below the two input fields.
			Inject XSS into the "key" field. This is output
			into the message. Craft a XSS to read the DOM storage or perform other 
			action.
